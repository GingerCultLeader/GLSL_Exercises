GLSL_Exercises
==============

Additional fragment shader exercises from Randy J. Rost's "OpenGL Shading Language", 2nd edition adapted to work with Dr. Robert Kooima's panoptic.

To use:
  -Install Panoptic
  -Create .thumb/glsl folders
  -Add fragment shader files to the new glsl folder
  -Edit Moon.xml (or any other .xml file that you create to render visualizations)
    *Note: These shaders are untested on the panoramas
  -Run Panoptic and load the .xml file that you wish to view
